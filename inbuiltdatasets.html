\section{Embedded Datasets}
Several data sets – intended as learning tools – are automatically installed when <b><tt>R} is installed. Many more are installed within packages to complement learning to use those packages.  One of these is the famous ``\textit{iris}" data set, which is used in many data mining exercises.
<ul>
<li> To see what data sets are available – type <b><tt>data()</tt></b>.
<li> To load a data set, simply type in the name of the data set. 
<li> To specify that a specific data set is to be used for analysis, use the command <b><tt>attach()</tt></b>.

</ul>

Some data sets are very large. To just see the first few rows, we use the head() function.

<code>

<li>  To load a data set, simply type in the

<li>  To just see the first few (or last) rows, we

<li> The default number of rows of
