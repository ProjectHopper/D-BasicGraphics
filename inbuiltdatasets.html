\section{Embedded Datasets}
Several data sets – intended as learning tools – are automatically installed when \texttt{R} is installed. Many more are installed within packages to complement learning to use those packages.  One of these is the famous ``\textit{iris}" data set, which is used in many data mining exercises.
\begin{itemize}
\item To see what data sets are available – type \texttt{data()}.
\item To load a data set, simply type in the name of the data set. 
\item To specify that a specific data set is to be used for analysis, use the command \texttt{attach()}.

\end{itemize}

Some data sets are very large. To just see the first few rows, we use the head() function.
