<h3>Bartlett's test for Homogeneity of Variances</h3>
 

Equal variances across samples is called homogeneity of variances. Bartlett's test is used to test if multiple samples have equal variances. 
<p>
Some statistical tests, such as the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples.  The Bartlett test can be used to verify that assumption.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The null hypothesis is that each of the samples have equal variance.
<li> The alternative hypothesis states that at least one sample has a significantly different variance.
</ul>
