## Paired T test
The mean and standard deviation of the sample d values are
obtained by use of the basic formulas in Chapters 3 and 4, except
that d is substituted for X.

The mean difference for a set of differences between paired
observations is $\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_{i}}{n}$.

The deviations formula and the computational formula for the
standard deviation of the differences between paired observations
are, respectively,

$$
S_{d} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_{i}-\bar{d})^2}{n-1}}\\
S_{d} = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum (d^2)- n(\bar{d}^2)}{n-1}}\\
$$

The standard error of the mean difference between paired
observations is obtained for the standard error of the mean.
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}

$$
H_{0}: \mu_{d} = 0\\
H_{1}: \mu_{d} \neq 0\\
$$
