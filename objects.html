 		\frametitle{1.15 Data Objects}
 		As mentioned previously, R saves data as \textbf{objects}. Examples of data objects are
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item Vectors
 			\item Lists
 			\item Dataframes
 			\item Matrices
 		\end{itemize}
 		The simple objects we have created previously are simply single element vectors.

 		To list all items in an R environment, we use the \texttt{ls()} function. This provides a list of all data
 		objects accessible. Another useful command is \texttt{objects()}.

\subsection*{Listing all items in a workspace}
To list all items in an \texttt{R} environment, we use the \texttt{ls()} function. This provides a list of all data objects  accessible.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> ls()
 [1] "a"          "A"          "authors"    "b"          "books"     
 [6] "C"          "D"          "ex1"        "Gerb"       "Lst"       
[11] "m"          "m1"         "op"         "presidents" "r"         
[16] "showSmooth" "sm"         "sm.3RS"     "sm2"        "sm3"       
[21] "Trig"       "Vec1"       "x"          "X"          "x.at"      
[26] "x1"         "x2"         "x3R"        "y"          "Y"         
[31] "y.at"      
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\section{Removing items}
Sometimes it is desirable to save a subset of your workspace instead of the entire workspace. One option is to use the \texttt{rm()} function to remove unwanted objects right before exiting your \texttt{R} session; another possibility is to use the save function. 

The save function accepts multiple arguments to specify the objects you wish to save, or, alternatively, a character vector with the names of the objects can be passed to save through the \texttt{list=} argument. 

Once the objects to be saved are specified, the only other required option is the \texttt{file=option}, specifying the destination of the saved R object. Although there is no requirement to do so, it is common to use a suffix of \texttt{.rda} or \texttt{.RData} for saved \texttt{R} workspace files.

For example, to save the \texttt{R} objects x, y, and z to a file called \texttt{myData.rda} ,the following statements could be used:

\begin{verbatim}
> save(x,y,z,fil= ‘mydata.rda’)
\end{verbatim}
