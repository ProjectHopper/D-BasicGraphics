\subsection{Confidence Interval }
A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data. If independent samples are taken repeatedly from the same population, and a confidence interval calculated for each sample, then a certain percentage (confidence level) of the intervals will include the unknown population parameter. 

Confidence intervals are usually calculated so that this percentage is $95\%$, but we can produce $90\%$, $99\%$, $99.9\%$ (or whatever) confidence intervals for the unknown parameter. The width of the confidence interval gives us some idea about how uncertain we are about the unknown parameter. A very wide interval may indicate that more data should be collected before anything very definite can be said about the parameter.

{Confidence Interval}
<ul>
<li> General form of Confidence interval:<br> estimate $\pm$ (quantile $\times$ Std.Err)<br>
<li> Estimate: sample mean, sample proportion, difference of samples.
<li> quantile: quantile from $t$ distribution.
<li> Std.Err: Standard error for estimate.
<li> Lower and upper bounds are to be calculated.
<li> Sample standard deviations and sample sizes are usually relevant.
<li> Confidence: $100(1- \alpha)\%$ - use $alpha/2$ and $1-alpha/2$ quantiles.

<ul>
<li> Seven meas urements of the pH of a buffer solution gave the following results:
<br>

5.12 5.20 5.15 5.17 5.16 5.19 5.15. 

<li> Calculate (i) the 95\% and (ii) the 99\% confidence limits for the true pH
utilizing $R$.<br>

<li> The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample over the square root of the sample size `n'.
<br>

<li> $\mbox{Std.Err} = \mbox{std.dev} / \sqrt{n}$
<\ul>

{Confidence Interval: example}

<pre><code>
> x<-c(5.12, 5.20, 5.15, 5.17, 5.16, 5.19, 5.15)
> n=length(x)   #sample size
> alpha = 0.05  #alpha
>
> LB95=mean(x)+qt(alpha/2,n-1)*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
> UB95=mean(x)+ qt(1-alpha/2,n-1)*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
>
> LB95     
[1] 5.137975
> UB95
[1] 5.187739

</code></pre>

<p>


Thus the 95\% confidence interval for this problem is approximately [5:14; 5:19], while
using the same code only taking $\alpha$ =0.01 will give us [5:13; 5:20].
