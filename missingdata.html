<h3>Missing Data</h3>
<ul>
<li> In some cases the components of a vector may not be
completely known. When an element or value is 'not available' or a
'missing value' in the statistical sense, a place within a vector
may be reserved for it by assigning it the special value NA.

<li> In general any operation on an NA becomes an NA.
<li> The motivation for this rule is simply that if the specification of an operation
is incomplete, the result cannot be known and hence is not available.
</ul><p>

<h4> Missing Data</h4>
 		<ul>
 			<li> In some cases the entire contents of a vector may not be known. For example, missing data
 			from a particular data set. <li> A place can be reserved for this by assigning it the special value
 			NA.
 			NA is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator.
 			<li>  NA stands
 			for Not Available.
 			<li> Missing values can adversely affect calculations. Add \texttt{na.rm=T} to commands
 			
 			<pre><code>
 			\texttt{mean(X,na.rm=T)}
 			</code></pre><p>
 		</ul><p>
 	<br>

<ul>
<li> The command is.na() can be used to determine whether there
are any missing values in a data set, by means of a logical
vector.

\begin{verbatim}
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
\end{verbatim}
</ul><p>
