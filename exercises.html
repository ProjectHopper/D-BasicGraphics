Evaluate the following:
 
 the area of a circle of radius 2              
 the natural log of  100                            
 the log of 100 to the base 10    	(HINT: 	use the help command)
 the exponential of 10                            
 the square of 12                                          
 the sine of 1.5 π                          
 the absolute value of  -9              
 the square root of 110              
 the factorial of 6
 
 Rad = 2; Area = pi * Rad^2
 Area
 
 log(100)
 log(100,10)
 
 exp(10)
 12^2
 sin(1.5*pi)
 abs(-9)
 sqrt(110)
 
 factorial(6) 
 1:6
 prod(1:6)
 
 
 
 Exercise 2
 
 Suppose you keep track of your mileage each time you go to the petrol station. At your last 8 fill-ups the mileage was
 
 65311  65624  65908  66219  66499  66821  67145  67447
 
 Create a vector ‘miles’ from this data. Use the function <tt>diff()</tt> on the data. What does it give?
 
 
 You should see the number of miles between fill-ups. 
 <pre><code>
 miles = c(65311, 65624, 65908, 66219, 66499, 66821, 67145, 67447)
 x = diff(miles)
 </code></pre>
 
 
 
 
<ol>
<li> Find the minimum number and  the maximum of miles between fill-ups.
<li> How many values are there in our data set?
<li> Find the mean and median number of miles between fill-ups
<li> What is the standard deviation of miles between fill-ups? What is the variance?
<li> Compute the five number summary for both sets of data.
</ol>

<h3> Exercise 3 </h3>
 
 Your cell phone bill varies from month to month. Suppose your year has the following monthly amounts
 
 46 33 39 37 46 30 48 32 49 35 30 48
 
 Enter this data into a variable called ‘bill’. Use the sum() command to find the amount you spent this year on the cell phone. 
 
 1.      What is the smallest amount you spent in a month? 
 2.      What is the highest amount spent? 
 3.      What is the inter quartile range of this dataset?  		(use IQR() command)
 4.      Which month (i.e. index number ) has the largest value? 
 5.      How many months was the amount greater than €40?
 6.      What percentage was this?
 
<h3> Exercise 4 </h3>
 
 <pre><code>
 x = c(1,3,5,7,9)
 y = c(2,3,5,7,11,13)
 </code></pre>
 
 For the vectors x and y ,what happens when you run the following pieces of code?
 x+1
 y*2
 length(x); length(y)
 x + y
 sum(x>5) and sum(x[x>5])
 sum(x>5 | x< 3) # read | as 'or', & and 'and'
 y[3]
 y[-3]
