 		\frametitle{2.5 The \texttt{apropos()} Function}
 		\begin{itemize}
 		\item This function is very useful for determining what functions are available for a particular topic,
 		although the process requires a great deal of trial and error. 
 		\item Suppose we are looking for a
 		command to print out the session information. 
 		\item We would use a very short string (e.g. \textbf{essio})
 		that would plausibly be part of useful function names.
