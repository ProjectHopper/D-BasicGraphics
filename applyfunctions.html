<h4> <tt>lapply</tt> and <b><tt>sapply()</tt></b> </h4>

The local version of \texttt{apply()} is \texttt{lapply()}, which computes a function for each member of a list (provided each member  is compatible with the function argument, e.g. that the list member is numeric for a function like \texttt{mean()} ).
<p>
The <b><tt>lapply()</tt></b> command returns a list of the same length as a list “X”, each element of which is the result of applying a specified function to the corresponding element of X.

<br>


A user friendly version of <b><tt>lapply()</tt></b> is <b><tt>sapply()</tt></b>
The <b><tt>sapply()</tt></b> command is a variant of lapply() – returning a matrix instead of a list - again of the same length as a list “X”, each element of which is the result of applying a specified function to the corresponding element of X.

Using the “Apply” family of functions

The "apply" family of functions keep you from having to write loops to perform some operation on every row or every column of a matrix or data frame, or on every element in a list.

The “apply()” function
The apply() function is a powerful device that operates on arrays and, in particular, matrices.
The apply() function returns a vector (or array or list of values) obtained by applying a specified function to either the row or columns of an array or matrix.
To specify use for rows or columns, use the additional argument of 1 for rows, and 2 for columns.

# create a matrix of 10 rows x 2 columns
m <- matrix(c(1:10, 11:20), nrow = 10, ncol = 2)

# mean of the rows

apply(m, 1, mean)
# [1]  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15

# mean of the columns
apply(m, 2, mean)
#[1]  5.5 15.5

The local version of apply()is lapply(), which computes a function for each argument of a list., provided each argument is compatible with the function argument (e.g. that is numeric). 

The lapply() command returns a list of the same length as a list “X”, each element of which is the result of applying a specified function to the corresponding element of X.

A user friendly version of lapply() is sapply().

The sapply() command  is a variant of lapply() – returning a matrix instead of a list - again of the same length as a list X, each element of which is the result of applying a specified function to the corresponding element of X.

> x <- list(a=1:10, b=exp(-3:3), logic=c(T,F,F,T))
>
> # compute the list mean for each list element
>
> lapply(x,mean)

Complex Simulation Program

1)	Create a function called SumDice().
2)	Apply SumDice() n times to an initial value x
3)	Graph the data

SumDice = function(x){
	Temp1=sum(sample(1:6,x,replace=TRUE))
	return(Temp1)
	}

X=sapply(rep(100,100),SumDice)

DF1=data.frame(Index=1:1000,Sum=X)

The Birthday function
The R command pbirthday() computes the probability of a coincidence of a number of randomly chosen people sharing a birthday, given that there are n people to choose from.
Suppose there are four people in a room. The probability of two of them sharing a birthday can be computed as follows:
> pbirthday(4)
[1] 0.01635591

Answer:  about 1.6 %
How many people do you need for a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday?
(starting from 2 – so the 5th element corresponds to 6 people, etc)

The answer is 23 people - probably much less than you thought!!
