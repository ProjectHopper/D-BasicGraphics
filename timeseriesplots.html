<h3> Time Series Data </h3>
Time Series Analysis is not part of the course. However, plotting time series data is very simple.
There are several plot types that can be used. To specify which type, use the \texttt{type=".."} argument in the \texttt{plot} command.

\begin{description}
\item[l] Line plot
\item[p] Points plot
\item[b] Line points with points superimposed (``b" is for both).
\end{description}
